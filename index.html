The room is structured as followed: First of all you have your posters - those are the accounts and hashtags you love and admire. You'll have the most important info of your timeline in one space. Then there are are your collecctions - these are like folders where you can store all kinds of posts and keep your room organized. Then there's your desk, where you'll be able to see all your posts and create new ones of course. At the bottom of the page you'll see your picture frames. That's where your most popular posts are situated.</p>
